Driven by the potential of AI to solve real-world engineering challenges, I am researching the application of machine learning to optimise 3D printing processes. In my PhD research, at <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/'>Imperial College London</a>, I developed algorithms to automatically identify and address potential flaws in metal 3D printed parts, aiming to improve quality and reduce production costs.

Prior to my PhD, I gained experience in the energy sector at <a href='https://www.equinor.com'>Equinor</a>, where I witnessed the challenges of adopting metal 3D printing at scale. This experience, coupled with my passion for learning, fuelled my decision to pursue research. Outside of academia, I enjoy tinkering with side-projects, reading books and participating in the occasional triathlon.
